  <h1>WEB</h1>
  <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5613/web" target="_blank" title="web specification">The Web</a> is the common name for the World Wide Web, <u>a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser.</u>
  <p>people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms interchangeably.
  <br>However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible.
  <br>So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same.</p>
